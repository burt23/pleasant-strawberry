          Custom printed parts are available in a variety of filaments, and are all made to order on an individual projet basis. First get in touch with us at 3d@xo9.io and we can start a dialog to evaluate the time and feasibility to get you a final printing quote.
          That being said most products are able to be printed within a week, but please allow 2-3 weeks if custom CAD designs are required.
